# Ideas for VIP-Gold

**Random Ideas:**
- Extra Home spawns
- Access to different warp portals (nether, dungeons, castles, server-made towns)
- Able to post more auction house items at 1 time (limit the amount of things for normal users or make an auto auction button for premium that will automatically list at a good price)
- Custom kits? Daily custom kits. Weekly. Monthly.
- Higher daily payout from economy
- Can /ignoreserver to mute all the server popups that can be rather annoying in chat or on screen. (like "invite your friends here" or "discord linK:")
- Private Discord Mic Channel (This could get cluttery bad, maybe only offer to VIP Platinum members, which is above VIP-diamond, so only really high rank donators)
- Private TeamSpeak Mic Channel (same thing applies)
Also upgrades on SickGaming Website if they sign up for an account. VIP Gold/ VIP Diamond groups with their own custom tutorials and information.
