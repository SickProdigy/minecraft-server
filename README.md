This is a backup generally of [zrips.com/residence](https://www.zrips.net/residence/) with many edits made by me. 

I will be uploading config files I think should be pretty standard when starting a survival MC server soon.

Some information will be changed and/or updated. Some explanations were slightly vague, so I will try to put more detail into where I believe there needs to be, along with cutting out a lot of extras that isn't really necessary IMO.
